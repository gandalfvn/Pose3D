# Reading list and research resources on 3D pose estimation and reconstruction 

## Selected papers

* Rethinking Reprojection: Closing the Loop for Pose-aware Shape Reconstruction from a Single Image. ICCV'17. Arxiv [1707.04682](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04682 "PDF"). [Supplementary Material](http://www.hamedkiani.com/uploads/5/1/8/8/51882963/rr_sup.pdf "PDF").

* MarrNet: 3D Shape Reconstruction via 2.5D Sketches. Arxiv [1711.03129](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03129 "PDF").

## Simulators

* [CARLA](http://www.carla.org/) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.
